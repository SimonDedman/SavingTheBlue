Dear reader,
Here you find the supplementary material for our paper: "Identifying movement states from location data using cluster analysis" by Van Moorter B., Jerde C.J., Visscher D.R., Frair J.L., Merrill E.H.

Three files are provided:
1. the data file (comma-separated values) we used in our manuscript: "data.csv"
2. a modified version of the clusterSim (R-package) function index.Gap: "gap.statistic.r". This modification allows for an easy calculation of the GAP-statistic for a given number of clusters.
3. a wrapper R-script that loads the data and the GAP-function and demonstrates how the analysis works: "analysis_suppl.r"

In order for you to replicate our analysis:
1. make sure that you have installed a working version of R
2. install also the R-package "clusterSim" with all its dependencies
3. check whether all three above mentioned files are in R's working directory
4. run the script "analysis_suppl.r" and follow the instructions in this file

If there are any problems with the script, please contact:
bram.van.moorter@gmail.com

the authors are interested in feedback, comments or simply applications of the method and scripts provided.

Sincerely,
for the authors:
Bram Van Moorter
